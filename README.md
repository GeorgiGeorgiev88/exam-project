This is a project that I created to complete the last stage of my studies in SoftUni.
I built the project as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React and Vite.
This site reflects the most significant events that have shaped humanity.
First, you need to create a user. Afterward, you can create an event. If you are the creator of the event, you have the ability to edit or delete it. If you are not the creator, you can only view the event and create comments.You can use predefined user "peter@abv.bg" and password "123456" to login in!
On the site, I have implemented fundamental React concepts, as well as HTML and CSS.To gain maximum insight, use Full HD resolution to your screen. Enjoy yourself


Ð¢o start the project run the following sequence:

1) Open Integrated Terminal in client folder and run the following commands : "npm i vite" ,then "npm run dev"

2) Open Integrated Terminal in server folder and run the following commands : "node server.js"
